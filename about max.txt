About Max
By Will Dillon

	Snow was falling steadily when Max woke up at six to get ready for
work. He flipped on the news while he started breakfast, watching Deborah
Donner on the news trying to remain calm while giving the forecast. They
weren't used to snow like this down here, expecially not so early in the
season. Max was, though, he was born in the cold north and emigrated twenty
some-odd years ago. The forecast said to expect 3-6 inches of snow at least,
but to remain calm.
	Max rolled his eyes and started getting dressed. The studio apart-
ment was small and grimy but he'd done his best, a decent bedframe with 
headboard, a chest of drawers and lots of wall art. The lighting that came 
with the apartment cast a yellow hue to everything and he'd very quickly
decided to buy floor lamps to save his eyes. He strode to the chest of 
drawers and slipped into some boxers, thermal underwear and jeans. He debated,
then added a thermal underwear top before a sweater and his coat. Hat, gloves
and scarf and he was through the door.
	"For the price, in this city, I can't do better" Max thought to him-
self as he pressed the elevator call button, which failed to light up or 
react in any way. "But I do wish I were closer to street level". Ten winding floors down and be burst through the doors into the morning.
